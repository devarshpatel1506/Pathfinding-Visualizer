## 1) Executive Summary

**On the surface:** This is an interactive **React single-page application** that lets users set start/goal nodes, draw obstacles, and visually compare how different pathfinding algorithms explore a grid.  

**Under the hood:** Itâ€™s an **SDE-quality project** that demonstrates:
- **Algorithm engineering** â†’ BFS/DFS/Dijkstra/A* implemented as **pure, testable functions** separated from UI code.  
- **Complexity awareness** â†’ correct handling of weighted vs. unweighted graphs, heuristics in A*, and clear trade-offs between optimality and speed.  
- **Front-end systems design** â†’ decoupling of algorithm logic, state management, animation scheduling, and rendering.  
- **Performance-oriented UI** â†’ O(1) grid updates, frame batching, and smooth requestAnimationFrame-driven animation.  
- **Software craftsmanship** â†’ modular structure, React component decomposition, maintainable styles, and live deployment (GitHub Pages).

### 1.1 Why This Project Matters

- **Education**: Helps students and engineers see abstract graph algorithms in action.  
- **Engineering practice**: Shows how to design **separation of concerns** in a front-end system (algorithm engine vs. rendering engine).  
- **Interview readiness**: Proves fluency in **algorithms + data structures** *and* modern **front-end frameworks**.  
- **Portfolio polish**: Deployed, interactive, visually appealing, and technically rich.
